- GitHub

## Git Commands Used
- git init
- git status
- git add
- git commit
- git branch
- git checkout
- git merge
- git push


## Branches Used
- master (default branch)
- feature-ui
- test-validation
- bugfix-balance
- experiment-darkmode

## Branching and Merging
Each feature and fix was developed in a separate branch. Merges were performed using Git Bash.
A merge conflict was intentionally created in the README file and resolved manually and an conflit was created in style.css was resolved manully and it was not intentionally created.

## Merge Conflict Resolution
A conflict occurred when two branches modified the same line in the README file and style.css.
The conflict was resolved by manually editing the file and committing the corrected version.
